# botanic-algorithm-js-animation

Since i was a kid, i was facinated by flowers and patterns that nature uses in its creations. In this Javascript project i tried to show how these patterns work using botanic mathematical formulas<br>
and apply them to an HTML canvas to get a smooth animation that ends up creating the same pattern found in different types of flowers.

This is not a serious project just a small tool i hacked in a small period of time.
